# History-of-World-War-II
The Topic of this first project is centered around a dark time in the History of mankind. I decided to create this website in correlation with topics that were suggested for our project as per our syllabus outlined by Code Institute.

The Learning outcomes for this Project include, but are not limited to the following criteria :

(i) Design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML and CSS based on the principles of User experience, design, accessibility & responsivity. (ii) Test a Front-End web application through the development, implementation and deployment stages. (iii) Deploy a Front-End web application to a Cloud platform such as GitHub, by using Visual Studio Code, or CodeAnywhere IDE. (iv) Maximise future maintainability through it's documentation, code structure and organisation. (v) Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub.

In this project, we are asked to try to build a static front-end website site so as to to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that we have learned about so far, that being mainly, HTML and CSS coding techniques.

The creator of this website (the student) has endeavoured to provide and present data to help the website user(s) achieve their objectives, or goals (e.g.) to inform and educate themselves and to learn about a service, a place, a product, or an event that the User is interested in, and/or, for the User to read, consume and enjoy the information and facts that are provided to the User in an interesting and enjoyable way.

The presentation of the web site creator's data advances the site owner's objectives, or goals. For example, it helps them to market a product, or a service that the creator can offer to it's User(s) or consumers.

As creator of this website, I have endeavoured to fulfill the criteria for this project as outlined by the Code Institute's project assessment guide, which outlines the following :

(i) Build a History website (ii) Goals - The External Userâ€™s goal includes, but is not limited to, being provided with Historical facts surrounding a particular Historical event, an Historical place, a particular person, and/or, a particular artefact.

For example - some Historical events that I had considered for this project included topics such as ;

The Spanish Civil War The Crimean War The Israeli Palestinian conflict The 1st & 2nd World Wars The Roman Empire The Irish Civil War The Ottoman Empire Former Presidents of The United States

Examples of Historical persons that I had considered for this project included ;

Charles Darwin Nelson Mandela Jesus Christ John F. Kennedy Michael Collins Archimedes & Aristotle Isaac Newton Alan Turing Sigmund Freud

Examples of Historical Artefacts, or Places that I had considered for this project included ;

The Shroud of Turin StongeHenge Wiltshire, England The Rosetta Stone The Dead Sea Scrolls The Jules Rimet Trophy The Colleseum in Rome Machu Picchu in Peru The Pyramids in Egypt Easter Island in The Pacific

The Jules Rimet Trophy was designed and created by a French Lawyer for the winners of the Soccer World Cup. 
This Historical artefact intrigues me personally, as I have a particular interest in sports, especially Football.

As I also have a passionate interest in History, I decided to build my website project around the events of the 2nd World War (1939 - 1945)

I have endeavoured to do this by way of creating a website that gives a deep understanding and meaning to the User in relation to the events that occurred during of the 2nd World War.

Site owner's goal : As creator of this website, my goal in creating this website, was to give a highly accurate, deep and realisic description & account of the horrific tragedies that occurred during the 2nd World War, a conflict which engulfed the world into terror and chaos.

I have also endeavoured to provide reliable sources of information in relation to World War II by way of locating & presenting accurate information from the World Wide Web for consumption by Users.

I provided and delivered this information chiefly by way of motion picture video clips, colour images and written text from reliable sources such as : www.Britannica.org and various other non-profit & government websites.

I have also included a vast array of facts & reports from journals and Historians from all over the world, with each one giving their own unique account of the events of the 2nd world war.

The objective of this website was also to provide a User with highly informative facts that would preserve a User's interest whilst viewing this website.

I tried to achieve this by way of making my website an enjoyable & memorable website to read, navigate and consume by providing the User with compounding facts and eye witness accounts of events of the 2nd World War.

This website has features which include, but are not limited to (a) Timeline of Events >> 1939 to 1945 (b) Evidence based information & facts (c) Images, videos and text supporting the content that I have presented in my website.

I hope you will enjoy viewing it!
