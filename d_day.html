<h1>D-Day 6th June 1944</h1>

<p>The D-Day operation of June 6th 1944 brought together the land, air, and sea forces of the allied armies in what became known as the largest amphibious invasion in military history. The invasion - code named Operation OVERLORD delivered 5 Naval assault divisions to the beaches of Normandy, in France. The beaches were given the code names UTAH, OMAHA, GOLD, JUNO, and SWORD. The invasion force included 7,000 war ships and landing craft manned by over 195,000 Naval personnel from 8 allied countries. Almost 133,000 troops from the United States, the British Commonwealth, and their allies, landed on the beaches of Normandy on the 6th June 1944. Casualties from these countries during the landing were estimated at 10,300 soldiers. By June the 30th over 850,000 men, 148,000 vehicles & 570,000 tons of supplies had landed on the Normandy shores. Fighting by the brave soldiers, sailors and air men of the Allied forces Western front, and Russian forces on the Eastern front, finally lead to the defeat of the German Nazi forces.

<p>General Eisenhower's determination that "Operation OVERLORD" (D-Day) would bring a quick end to the war is obvious in his message to the troops of the Allied Expeditionary Forces on 6th June 1944 - the morning of the invasion.</p>

<p>6th June 1944 "The Light of Dawn" tells the story of Operation Overlord, which is to date the largest military operation that man has ever conceived. From the summer of 1941 until June 6th 1944. The landing is told like a Historical drama with it's intrigues, it's twists and it's thousands of young men who would die there. Entirely produced with cropped and colourized archives, this film by Jean-Christophe Rosé was broadcast on France Télévisions as part of the 70th Anniversary of the D-Day landings in June 2014. It is one of the best audiences for a History documentary.</p>
